## Project #2: Music Playlist Explorer

### Overview

In the "Music Playlist Explorer" project, you will develop a web application that enables users to browse a curated selection of music playlists. The site features a clean, user-friendly interface where playlists are displayed as interactive tiles. Users can like playlists or click on a tile to open a modal with detailed information, including a list of songs. Within the modal view, users can shuffle the order of songs for a fresh listening experience.

### üéØ Goals

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

- [ ] Write HTML and apply CSS styling to create a clean and user-friendly interface for the application.
- [ ] Dynamically render music playlists on a web page using JavaScript and data from a JSON file.
- [ ] Create and manipulate modal views to display detailed information about each playlist.
- [ ] Implement interactive features such as liking playlists and shuffling songs within a playlist.

### Required Features

- [ ] **Styling**: Apply CSS to style the main page, ensuring a clean and attractive user interface. Use responsive design principles to make sure your application looks good on different screen sizes.

- [ ] **Display Playlists**: Dynamically render playlists on the homepage using JavaScript. Fetch data from a provided JSON file and use it to create interactive playlist tiles that display the playlist's cover image, name, creator, and like count.

- [ ] **Playlist Details**: Create a modal view that displays detailed information about a playlist when a user clicks on a playlist tile. The modal should show the playlist's cover image, name, creator, and a list of songs, including their titles, artists, and durations.

- [ ] **Like Playlists**: Implement functionality to allow users to like playlists by clicking a heart icon on each playlist tile. Update the like count on the playlist tile when a playlist is liked or unliked, providing immediate visual feedback to the user.

- [ ] **Shuffle Songs**: Enable users to shuffle the songs within a playlist using a shuffle button in the playlist detail modal. Rearrange the songs in the modal view when the shuffle button is clicked, providing immediate visual feedback to the user.

### üí° Hints

- Help! I don't know where to start with the modal!
  - Begin by creating a hidden modal element in your HTML. Use CSS to style it and JavaScript to toggle its visibility.
