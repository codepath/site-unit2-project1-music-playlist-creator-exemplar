## Project #2: Music Playlist Explorer

### Overview

In the "Music Playlist Explorer" project, you will develop a web application that enables users to browse a curated selection of music playlists. The site features a clean, user-friendly interface where playlists are displayed as interactive tiles. Users can like playlists or click on a tile to open a modal with detailed information, including a list of songs. Within the modal view, users can shuffle the order of songs for a fresh listening experience.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

- [ ] Write HTML and apply CSS styling to create a clean and user-friendly interface for the application.
- [ ] Dynamically render music playlists on a web page using JavaScript and data from a JSON file.
- [ ] Create and manipulate modal views to display detailed information about each playlist.
- [ ] Implement interactive features such as liking playlists and shuffling songs within a playlist.

### Required Features

- [ ] **Display Playlists**: Dynamically render playlists on the homepage using JavaScript. Fetch data from a provided JSON file and use it to create interactive playlist tiles that display the playlist's cover image, name, creator, and like count.

- [ ] **Playlist Details**: Create a modal view that displays detailed information about a playlist when a user clicks on a playlist tile. The modal should show the playlist's cover image, name, creator, and a list of songs, including their titles, artists, and durations.

- [ ] **Like Playlists**: Implement functionality to allow users to like playlists by clicking a heart icon on each playlist tile. Update the like count on the playlist tile when a playlist is liked or unliked, providing immediate visual feedback to the user.

### Project Instructions

<details>
<summary style="font-size:1.2em; font-weight: 600">Milestone 0: Project Setup</summary>

## Goal

The goal for this milestone is to cover all the setup needed at the beginning of this project, which includes:

1. Creating the project structure
2. Setting up the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
3. Loading the starter data from a JSON file

## Requirements

### Create Project Structure

1. Create a new directory for your project, for example, `music-playlist-explorer`.
2. Inside this directory, create the following files and folders:
   - `index.html`: This will be the main HTML file for your project.
   - `style.css`: This will contain all the CSS styles for your project.
   - `script.js`: This will contain the main JavaScript code for your project.
   - `data/`: This will be a directory to store your JavaScript file containing the playlist data.

### Setting Up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Files

1. Open your `index.html` file and set up the basic HTML structure. Link your CSS and JavaScript files by adding the following lines in the `<head>` section:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   ```

2. Add a website title and favicon to the browser tab by adding the following lines in the `<head>` section:

   ```html
   <title>Music Playlist Explorer</title>
   <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="assets/img/favicon.ico">
   ```

3. Add the following lines at the end of the `<body>` section to link your JavaScript files:

   ```html
   <script src="data/data.js"></script>
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```

4. Start writing your CSS styles in `style.css`.
5. Start writing your JavaScript logic in `script.js`.

### Loading Starter Data

1. Create a JavaScript file inside the `data/` directory, for example, `data.js`. This file will contain the initial data for your playlists in JSON format, assigned to a variable. For example:

   ```javascript
   let data = {
     "playlists": [
       {
         "playlistID": 1,
         "playlist_name": "Chill Vibes",
         "playlist_creator": "DJ Cool",
         "playlist_art": "path/to/image.jpg",
         "songs": [
           {
             "title": "Relaxing Song",
             "artist": "Artist Name",
             "album": "Album Title",
             "duration": "3:45",
             "cover_art": "path/to/song/image.jpg"
           },
           // More songs...
         ]
       },
       // More playlists...
     ]
   };
   ```

2. In your `script.js`, you can reference the `data` variable to access the playlist data, as it is globally available due to the order of the script tags in the HTML file.

## Running the Project

1. Open your project directory in VS Code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view your project.
3. As you make changes to your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, refresh the browser to see the updates.

<summary style="font-size:1.2em; font-weight: 600">Milestone 1: Adding Structure with HTML</summary>



## Goal

The goal of this milestone is to set up the basic structure of your web application using HTML. This includes creating the main layout, adding a sample playlist card, and setting up a modal for displaying playlist details.

## Requirements

1. **Create the Main Layout**:
   - Open your `index.html` file.
   - Set up the basic structure of your application with a header, a main section for the playlist gallery, and a footer.

    ```html
    <header>
        <div class="header-container">
            <h1>Music Playlist Explorer</h1>
        </div>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section class="playlist-gallery">
            <!-- Playlist cards will be dynamically inserted here -->
        </section>

        <!-- Modal overlay will be added here -->
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!-- Your footer content here -->
    </footer>
    ```

2. **Create Playlist Card Container**:
   - Inside the main section, create a container for the playlist cards with the class `playlist-cards`.

    ```html
    <div class="playlist-cards">
        <!-- Playlist cards will be dynamically inserted here -->
    </div>
    ```

3. **Add a Sample Playlist Card**:
   - Inside the `playlist-cards` container, add a hard-coded playlist card.
   - This card should include an image, playlist title, creator name, and like count.
   - This will serve as a template for styling and will be replaced with dynamic content in later milestones.

    ```html
    <!-- Sample Playlist Card -->
    <div class="card">
        <img src="path/to/sample-image.jpg" alt="Playlist Cover" class="playlist-cover">
        <div class="card-content">
            <h3 class="playlist-title">Sample Playlist</h3>
            <p class="creator-name">Created by John Doe</p>
            <div class="card-stats">
                <span class="like-count">42 Likes</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <!-- End of Sample Playlist Card -->
    ```

4. **Create Modal Overlay**:
   - Outside the main section, create a modal overlay structure with the class `modal-overlay`.
   - This will be used to display the modal content.

    ```html
    <div class="modal-overlay">
        <!-- Modal content will be dynamically added and removed from here -->
    </div>
    ```

5. **Create Modal Content Container**:
   - Inside the modal overlay, create a container for the modal content with the class `modal-content`.

    ```html
    <div class="modal-content">
        <!-- Modal content will be dynamically added and removed from here -->
    </div>
    ```

6. **Add Sample Modal Content**:
   - Inside the `modal-content` container, add hard-coded content for the modal.
   - This should include a close button, playlist details, and a list of songs.
   - Initially, this modal can be hard-coded with sample data.

    ```html
    <!-- Sample Modal Content -->
    <div class="modal-header">
        <img src="path/to/sample-image.jpg" alt="Playlist Cover" class="playlist-cover">
        <div class="playlist-info">
            <h3 class="playlist-title">Sample Playlist</h3>
            <p class="creator-name">Created by John Doe</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
        <ul>
            <li>Song 1 - Artist 1</li>
            <!-- More songs -->
        </ul>
    </div>
    <!-- End of Sample Modal Content -->
    ```

### ðŸ’¡ Hints

<!--- Hints go here, in Q&A format -->

- Help! I don't know where to start!
  - As always, a good starting place would be to set up the XML Layout for your app.
  - Look at this weeks lab for examples on how to implement similar applications.  What code will be similar?  What do you need to change?

- I'm stuck on something!
  - Don't just skip the Resources section!
  - Still need a little extra help getting started or running into an error?  Try posting in the [Discussions](https://discussions.codepath.com/).

- How do I dynamically render playlists on the homepage?
  - Use JavaScript to iterate over the playlist data from the JSON file and create HTML elements for each playlist. Then, append these elements to the playlist container on the homepage.
  - You can use the `createElement` and `appendChild` methods in JavaScript to create and add new elements to the DOM.

- How can I update the like count when a playlist is liked?
  - Add an event listener to the like button for each playlist. When the button is clicked, increment the like count for that playlist and update the displayed count in the DOM.
  - You may need to use a variable or data attribute to keep track of the like count for each playlist.

- How do I create a modal view for playlist details?
  - Create a hidden modal element in your HTML with a structure for displaying playlist details. Use CSS to style the modal and make it appear centered and above the rest of the content.
  - Use JavaScript to populate the modal with the details of the clicked playlist and to toggle the visibility of the modal when a playlist tile is clicked or when the modal is closed.

- How can I shuffle the songs in a playlist?
  - Write a function that takes an array of songs and rearranges the elements in a random order.
  - When the shuffle button in the modal is clicked, call this function with the current playlist's songs array and update the displayed song list in the modal.
