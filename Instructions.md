## Project #2: Music Playlist Explorer

### Overview

In the "Music Playlist Explorer" project, you will develop a web application that enables users to browse a curated selection of music playlists. The site features a clean, user-friendly interface where playlists are displayed as interactive tiles. Users can like playlists or click on a tile to open a modal with detailed information, including a list of songs. Within the modal view, users can shuffle the order of songs for a fresh listening experience.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- [ ] Implement interactive features such as liking playlists and shuffling songs within a playlist.

### Required Features
